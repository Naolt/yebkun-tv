# Backend Implementation Requirements

This document outlines the backend requirements for implementing a fully functional Orthotics Portal system.

## Technology Stack Recommendations

- **Programming Language**: Node.js or Python
- **Web Framework**: Express.js (Node) or Django/Flask (Python)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 or equivalent cloud storage
- **PDF Generation**: PDFKit (Node) or ReportLab (Python)

## Core Backend Services

### 1. Authentication Service

- User registration and login
- Role-based access control (Clinicians, Administrators, Lab Technicians)
- Password reset functionality
- Session management
- Security features (rate limiting, CSRF protection)

### 2. Prescription Management Service

- Create, read, update, delete (CRUD) operations for prescriptions
- Validation of prescription data
- Storage of prescription history and versions
- Attachment handling for scans and images

### 3. Order Processing Service

- Order creation from prescriptions
- Order status tracking and updates
- Order history and audit trail
- Notifications for status changes

### 4. PDF Generation Service

- Generate detailed PDF summaries of prescriptions
- Include all prescription parameters
- Support for clinic branding/letterhead
- Digital signature support

### 5. Patient Management Service

- CRUD operations for patient records
- Patient history tracking
- HIPAA compliance measures
- Data encryption for sensitive information

### 6. Inventory Management Service (Optional)

- Track materials and supplies
- Low stock alerts
- Usage reporting

## Integration Requirements

### 1. Lab System Integration

- API for sending prescription data to manufacturing systems
- Status updates from manufacturing process
- Quality control checkpoints

### 2. Payment Processing

- Integration with payment gateways
- Invoice generation
- Payment tracking

### 3. Shipping Integration

- Shipping label generation
- Tracking information
- Delivery confirmation

## Security Requirements

- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Regular security audits
- HIPAA compliance for patient data
- Secure API authentication
- Input validation and sanitization
- Protection against common vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection)

## Performance Requirements

- Response time < 500ms for API requests
- Support for concurrent users (initially 50-100 simultaneous users)
- Scalability considerations for future growth
- Caching strategy for frequently accessed data

## Deployment Considerations

- Containerization with Docker
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Environment configuration management
- Logging and monitoring
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures
